As part of my internship at [AnalyticsProfile](https://analyticsprofile.com/), I created blogs on machine learning applications, exploratory data analysis, data engineering and dashboard creation that are easy to consume by a novice audience. For one of the projects, I worked with cricket dataset and it was [published](https://analyticsprofile.com/category/analytics-in-cricket/?utm_source=homepage-button-2) as a series of 3 blogs and the content is available here as well.
